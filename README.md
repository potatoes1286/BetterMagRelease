# Potatoes' Better Mag Release
Better Mag Release is a mod that makes reloading just a bit more fun, to mimic how firearms are reloaded in real life!

Compatible with streamlined mode!

## Paddle Release
Paddle release guns must have their magazines removed by grabbing the mag and pressing down on touchpad with the hand holding the mag.

EX: AK47.

## Eject Release
Eject release guns must be ejected by pressing down on the touchpad with your firing hand. Grabbing the magazine does not release the mag!

However, you can grab the magazine and ejecting it will drop it right into your hand.

EX: AR15 Style Rifles

## Foregrip Release
This allows certain guns that are held by the magwell, such as the MP40, to have their magazines released directly from the foregrip! Simply press down on the touchpad with your supporting hand holding the foregrip, and it will eject the mag!

## Extracting Rounds
While every break action weapon in vanilla H3 will eject their rounds when you open it, in real life this isn't always true. In some shotguns, rounds will stay in the shotgun and you gotta pluck them out yourself.

Or, instead of grabbing them with your hand, you can create a shucking movement- similar to shaking shells out of a revolver, simply yank your gun backwards and they'll pop out under inertia.

EX: Wells 1864
